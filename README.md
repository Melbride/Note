### How It Works

The model uses machine learning to analyze your input data:
- **Target Percentage**: The percentage of your goal you want to achieve.
- **Deadline**: The date by which you aim to complete your goal.
- **Historical Performance**: Data from your previous coding progress.

Based on this, it predicts your progress and provides suggestions for optimization.

**Note**: The progress prediction and optimization suggestions feature is still under development. Stay tuned for updates!
